    "This Python script is designed to interact with the Riot Games API for fetching League of Legends game data. Here's a quick overview of what each part does:\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Environment Setup**: Loads API keys and other sensitive data from a `.env` file to keep them secure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Configuration**: Sets up several constants to be used with the Riot Games API:\n",
    "  - `region` and `continent` for location-specific data.\n",
    "  - `queue_id` and `queue` for filtering games by type.\n",
    "  - `number_of_games` and `number_of_players` to control the amount of data fetched.\n",

    "- It creates a new CSV file named `dataset.csv` to store the extracted match data. The headers for this file are dynamically generated to include champion picks for both the blue and red teams across all roles (Top, Jungle, Mid, Bot, Support), their bans, and a column to indicate whether the blue team won.\n",

    "- For each game ID, the script fetches detailed match information from the Riot Games API, ensuring it only proceeds with matches that have complete data.\n",
    "- It processes the fetched data to:\n",
    "  - Identify and record champion bans for both teams.\n",
    "  - Match each player's chosen champion to their role and team, utilizing predefined mappings for team colors and roles.\n",
    "  - Exclude any matches that lack complete role data, maintaining the integrity of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating and Writing Data Rows:\n",
    "- Generates a row for each match where:\n",
    "  - Each cell corresponds to a specific champion-role combination or a ban, marked '1' if applicable (champion was picked/banned) and '0' otherwise.\n",
    "  - The final cell in each row indicates whether the blue team won the match ('1' for a win, '0' for a loss).\n",
    "- These rows are then appended to `dataset.csv`, compiling a detailed dataset suitable for further analysis.\n",

    "### Rate Limit Compliance:\n",
    "- Implements pauses between API requests to comply with rate limiting, preventing the script from being blocked for excessive querying.\n",
